The main code is "NPV_Final.py" code.
It uses "CO2_interpolation.py" and "Water_interpolation.py" as the sidecodes.
The adjustable '.DATA' file should be located in the same directory as "NPV_Final.py" with these adjustments.
However, it could be changed!
The Static data files should be put in the "INCLUDE" folder.

Instructions:
Open the "NPV_Final.py" script.
Put the name of the '.DATA' file in the script.
Put the name of the wells in the script.
Choose the pattern of the desired injection rates and the loop numbers.
Adjust the desired Scenario Cluster name.
Run it! and debug the probable failures.
